The useState is a React hook that allows functional components to manage state. 
It provides a way to declare state variables in functional components,
enabling them to hold and update state over the lifecycle of the component.

Syntax:
const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);

Explanation:
1 - Initialization:
The useState function is called with an initial state value (in this example, 0), and it returns an array with two elements.

2 - State Variable and Update Function:
The first element of the array (count in this case) is the current state value.
The second element (setCount in this case) is a function that allows you to update the state.

3 - Rendering:
The current state value (count) can be used in the component's rendering logic.

4 - Updating State:
To update the state, you call the update function (setCount) with the new value.
React then re-renders the component with the updated state.


Rules for Hook
1 - Must be written inside function compoenent.
2 - Must be import in compoent.
3 - Must be call at top level of compoenent.
4 - cannot be conditional.
